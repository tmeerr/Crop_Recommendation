#Crop Recommendation System
==========================

This is a Crop Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. The system predicts the best crop that fits a given set of agricultural parameters.

#Installation
------------

To run the application, make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install them using pip:

    pip install numpy pandas streamlit pillow

Usage
-----

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tmeerr/Crop_Recommendation.git
    cd crop-recommendation-system
    ```

2. Ensure your environment is set up with the required packages.

3. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. Enter the values for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH Value, and Rainfall to get predictions on the best crop for your farm land.

5. Click on "Predict the Crop" to see the predicted crop.

6. Optionally, click on "Click here to get Dataset" to download the dataset used for training the model.

#About
-----

This project utilizes Machine Learning to recommend crops based on agricultural input parameters. It demonstrates the use of the Random Forest algorithm for achieving accurate predictions.
